This is an example of HTML for an Amazon Mechanical Turk HIT external
question that uses JavaScript to perform the post-back to the
Mechanical Turk web server.

An Amazon Mechanical Turk HIT can use an "external question," question
data served from your own web server.  An external question appears
inside a box in the worker's web browser.  When Mechanical Turk
renders the box, it appends an assignmentId parameter to the URL of
the external question web page if the worker is working on the HIT.
The web form on the page is responsible for including the assignmentId
value in the data posted back to Mechanical Turk's web server by the
form.

This example uses JavaScript to find the assignmentId in the URL and
include it in the form's data.  This technique allows you to use an
external question with a web server without server-side logic to
insert the assignment ID.  For example, you might do this to host your
external question with Amazon S3.

If no assignmentId is present, this example changes the display to
inform the worker that the HIT is being previewed, and tells the
worker to accept the HIT before submitting results.
